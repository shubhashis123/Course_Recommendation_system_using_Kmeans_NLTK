Facial expressions relay a lot of non-verbal information about our characters, and Mudbox can make creating those expressions really easy and a lot of fun. In this course, we'll talk about several concepts to keep in mind when building facial expressions, such as the muscles of the face, how the skin reacts when the muscles move it into an expression, and some important tips to keep in mind when working. We'll cover methods in Mudbox for sculpting different expressions and how to use sculpt layers to create an extremely flexible workflow. Finally, we'll look at a couple of ways that we can get our expressions into Maya in order to set up animatable blendshapes. Once done, you'll have a better understanding of how you can use Mudbox and Maya to create appealing facial expressions for your own characters. Software required: Mudbox 2011, Maya 2011.\",\n",

However, before solving the problem, you need to understand it. After an introduction to temporal problems and constraints, you will learn how to implement the solutions. Many solutions are much simpler with the help of a special Interval CLR data type. Additional relational operators PACK and UNPACK are handy as well. Of course, these two operators do not exist in the Transact-SQL language. You will learn how to implement them with help of other language elements. Having a SQL Server solution for a problem does not mean the job is done. Of course, the next immediate issue is performance. Temporal queries that involve intervals are typically very IO and CPU intensive. For example, a test for overlapping intervals was solved with inefficient queries for years. However, a handful of solutions with fast queries was developed recently. This course introduces five different methods to get efficient queries that search for overlapping intervals, one of the most complex temporal problems. Of course, these solutions can be implemented for other temporal problems as well. All the solutions presented should work on any edition of SQL Server from 2008 to 2014.\",\n",

              " \"This course is about how your database’s physical design either takes advantage of or is hindered by the way that the SQL Server platform works; knowing this can give you better long-term scalability, availability, and performance. Choosing the right data types when you're designing your columns, tables, and indexes is really critical. Using the wrong data type can cause more space to be required, affecting data density in memory, database and backup size, transaction log efficiency, and more. It's even more important when you're choosing your clustering keys, as the wrong choice there can cause nonclustered index sizes to balloon dramatically. It can even affect the performance of queries, when incompatible data types are used in comparisons and cause very costly operations to take place. This course will show you how to make the right choices and avoid all of these problems. It starts by explaining the various data structures that are used to store columns and rows, and how they can be affected by data type choice. Then it shows how data type choice factors into clustered and nonclustered index key choice. Finally it describes the implicit conversion and probe residual problems that can occur from mismatched data types used in queries. Packed with a wealth of information and practical, easy-to-follow demonstrations, this course will show you how to make the RIGHT choices to make sure you avoid all these common problems. The course is applicable for all SQL Server versions from SQL Server 2005 onward, and for SQL Server developers and anyone responsible for designing and creating SQL Server tables and indexes, with any level of experience.\",\n",

In this course, TDD with JUnit 5, you’ll learn the benefits of TDD (Test-driven Development) and help you create TDD applications using the JUnit 5 testing framework. First, you'll learn how to develop TDD applications and how to use mock objects with JUnit 5. Next, you'll discover how to move a non-TDD application into the platform. Finally, you'll dive into how to integrate JUnit5 into your workflow. By the end of this course, you'll have the know how to develop safe and flexible Java applications using TDD with JUnit 5.\",\n",
              " 'Python is a widely used scripting language that is integrated into NUKE to let us artists control the user interface, quickly modify many nodes, and integrate with external applications. By learning some Python commands and workflows we can extend NUKE and write scripts that let us focus on creating art. We will start this NUKE tutorial by echoing the Python commands that NUKE uses internally and begin writing our own code. From there we will learn how to correctly create nodes, set properties at node creation and have our scripts automatically run whenever NUKE starts up. From there, we can begin working on some projects, like a script that selects all nodes of a specific class based on user input and a script to automatically break a multi-channel EXR into individual auto-cropped shuffle nodes so we can begin compositing faster. Software required: NUKE 6.3v6.',\n",
